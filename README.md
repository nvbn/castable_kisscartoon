# Castable KissCartoon

Chrome extension that makes KissCartoon usable with Chromecast, but apparently makes
it worse without Chromecast.

The only feature is autoplay of the next episode in "fullscreen" on Chromecast.
It can't be disabled and it's not a real fullscreen in the browser.

You can leave "fullscreen" by pressing `Esc`.
